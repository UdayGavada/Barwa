- **Next.js Optimizations**: Server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and backend API routes for optimal performance.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React.js (hooks, context API)
  - Next.js (file-based routing, SSR, SSG, data fetching)
  - Tailwind CSS (styling)
  
- **Backend**:
  - Next.js API routes for handling backend logic
  - Sanity CMS for product and content management
  - Stripe for payment and checkout handling

## Learning Highlights

### Advanced React Best Practices
- **Folder Structure & Organization**: Modular and scalable folder structure for clean code and maintainability.
- **Hooks & Refs**: Leveraging hooks for state and side effects management. Refs for directly accessing and manipulating DOM elements.
- **React Context API**: Used for advanced global state management across the entire application, especially for cart functionalities.

### Next.js Best Practices
- **File-based Routing**: Simple and efficient routing system with dynamic routes for product pages.
- **Server-side Rendering (SSR) & Static Generation (SSG)**: Utilizing `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, and `getStaticPaths` for efficient data fetching and rendering, providing optimized performance and SEO benefits.
- **Backend API Integration**: Using Next.js API routes to act as a backend, handling server-side operations like fetching products and managing checkout.

### Stripe Integration
- **Real Payment Integration**: Stripe is used to handle real payments, including the management of products and shipping rates.
- **Checkout Process**: Secure and smooth checkout process managed with Stripeâ€™s API for both products and payments.

### Sanity CMS
- **Content Management**: Sanity is used to manage all product data, allowing you or your clients to edit product details and homepage content in real-time without code changes.
- **Unified Content Platform**: Sanity handles content, file storage, and databases, enabling a scalable e-commerce solution without additional overhead.
